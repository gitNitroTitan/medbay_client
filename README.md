## The Who, How, and Why

***

* **Primary Features**

The application allows a user to create a personal repository to save medications and record personal physicians that can be recalled. The application can be used by multiple users within a family unit, but users can only edit or delete records under their own authenticated repositories.

* **Target Audience**

This is for any user that wishes to explore and save hikes with content to their board for later use.

* **Purpose**

This project is for users who wish to keep track of their doctors and medications.

* **Getting Started**

You can start testing the product by logging in with your respective Google account or using the guest login button if you only wish to view the project without exploring all functions. If authenticated, use the home page buttons to view all the pins created in a random fashion. The best way to begin is to:

* Create a physician record on the physician form page which can be accessed by using the create physician button or the navbar link to create a physician.

* Create medication records under the medication form page. These medications are stored by user id.

* If a medication is needed to be recalled by diagnosis quickly, there is a keyword search on the landing page.

* The user can view a list of medications and can filter the listed medications by user. These lists cannot be edited from this view.

* Use the sign out button to exit the app.
